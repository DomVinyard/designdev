> I want my notes app to be the back-end for this content. I donâ€™t want to do anything except write little notes. No upload process, no logging in to anywhere, no faffing.

1. Create a new note every day with the date as the title (in the [correct format])
2. Write some stuff
3. Add a rocket emoji (ðŸš€) on the first line

Use any notes app that can sync with Dropbox. (I use [iA Writer]). Write anywhere, Dropbox keeps all your devices (and the blog) in sync at all times as a single source of truth.

### Usage

If you want to launch your own auto-deploy notes-as-a-backend blog this should be a good starting point. Clone this repo and set the following environment variables.

```
NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK=url # from Netlify
DROPBOX_TOKEN=string # from Dropbox
DROPBOX_FOLDER=string # The folder with your .md files
```

1. Link your repo to a Netlify Site
2. Get a [Dropbox Developers] token and create a folder in Dropbox for your notes
3. Configure a [Dropbox Webhook] to point at your `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK` endpoint
